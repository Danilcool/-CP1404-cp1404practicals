regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
I would say the accuracy of my anwers impoved with practice as well as more experience in my methods and my problem solving ability, I was able to analyse programs more effectively as well as break them down and use previous knowlage going futher down in the subject.

regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
Reviwing code and writing responces gave me more ability to understand and teach other my methods, But at the same time learn from strategies and intresting methods of solving problems in more effective way.
regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would probably change the start of the subject of reviwing and learning back code, I feel like only in week 5 i started to learn about new material.
